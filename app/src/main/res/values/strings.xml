    <string name="steps_instruction">The background color means how close you are to the suggestion today\'s step counts (8000)\nFrom red to green, red is far away from suggestion and green is for the suggestion\n\nwhile current recommendations aim for adults to walk 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day for optimal health, one study of U.S. adults found that walking 8,000 steps 1-2 days per week over 10 years of follow-up reduced the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. For those who have difficulty exercising regularly, every step counts, so incorporating walking whenever possible, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going for a walk during your lunch break, or walking with family after dinner, can have significant health benefits.</string>
